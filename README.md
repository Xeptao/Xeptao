# Hi, I'm Xeptao ✨ 🧑‍💻

I am a Front End Web Developer that tries to reach to more and more people by teaching you, and me. \
I always try to contribute to open-source and create services that help people in some shape-or-form. \
Due to my interest in privacy, I'm currently working on a privacy-first messenger called [Choccy](https://github.com/choccyapp/choccy/).
